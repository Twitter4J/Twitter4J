     * Site Streams, a new feature on the Streaming API, is now available for beta testing. Site Streams allows services, such as web sites or mobile push services, to receive real-time updates for a large number of users without any of the hassles of managing REST API rate limits. The initial version delivers events created by, or directed to, users that have shared their OAuth token with your application. The following events are streamed immediately, and without rate limits: Home Timelines, Mentions Timelines, User Timelines, Direct Messages, Mentions, Follows, Favorites, Tweets, Retweets, Profile changes, and List changes.
     * The following limitations must be respected during the beta period. These limitations may be changed with little advance notice. We intend to increase or remove these various limitations as we move from beta test into full production:<br>
     * Limit the follow count to 100 users per stream. Clients must occasionally compact users onto a smaller number of connections to minimize the total number of connections outstanding.<br>
     * Open no more than 25 new connections per second and exponentially back-off on errors.
     *
     * @param withFollowings whether to receive status updates from people following
     * @param follow         an array of users to include in the stream

     * The default access level allows up to 200 track keywords, 400 follow userids and 10 1-degree location boxes.
